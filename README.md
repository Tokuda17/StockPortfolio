# StockPortfolio

The goal of this project is to allow a user (me) input stock investments that I have made at a certain price then tracking the growth and overall performance. This project is mainly a way for me to learn the fundamentals of front end development. I plan to continue to develop this to learn more about programming. This is just a fun little project.
